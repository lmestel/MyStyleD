# Basic Style Dictionary

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

## TODO

- [ ] respect `outputReferences` in `css/json` format
- [ ] parse icons as token & build sprites with [actions](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/api?id=registeraction)
  - TBD: keep independent icon-sprite task for project specific icon sets
- [ ] move `filter` to custom formats
  - TBD: what about built in formats (like `css`)?
